    "### Data Leakage (excerpts from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/data-leakage))\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Data leakage (or leakage) happens when **your training data contains information about the target**, but similar data will not be available when the model is used for prediction. This leads to high performance on the training set (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target leakage** occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. It is important to think about target leakage in terms of the timing or chronological order that data becomes available, not merely whether a feature helps make good predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "[...] \n",
    "\n",
    "Validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data that it hasn't considered before. You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavior. This is sometimes called **train-test contamination**.\""
